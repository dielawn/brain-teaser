        If you choose an answer to this question at random what is the chance that you will be correct?
    <br>a. 25%
    <br>b. 0%
    <br>c. 50%
    <br>d. 25%   
        </div><br>
<button class="answerBtn" id="answerBtn">Show Answer</button>
<div class="answerDiv" id="answerDiv"></div>
<br><p>
            AI:
            The correct answer is b. 0%.
            
            Explanation: If you choose an answer at random, there are four possible options (a, b, c, d). Only one of those options, which is option b, states that the chance of being correct is 0%. Therefore, if you were to choose an answer at random, the chance of choosing the correct answer (0%) matches with option b.

        <br><p>
          Me:  So if you were correct 0% of the time you could never choose 0%, right?
        </p>

        <br><p>
           AI: You are correct. If someone's correctness rate is 0%, it means they are not getting any answers correct. Therefore, they cannot choose the answer "0%" because that would imply they got that particular answer correct, which contradicts the fact that their correctness rate is 0%. This is a classic example of a paradoxical situation where the response "0%" creates a logical contradiction in this context.

          Me:  What are the odds you would choose 25%?
        </p>

        <br><p>
          AI:  The odds of choosing "25%" would be 25%.

            In the given options, two choices mention "25%" as a possible answer: option "a. 25%" and option "d. 25%". Since there are four options in total, and two of them include "25%" as an answer, the <em>probability</em> of choosing "25%" randomly would be 2 out of 4, which simplifies to 50%. However, you specifically asked about the <em>odds</em>, which is often expressed as a ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is choosing "25%", and the total outcomes are the four options. So, the odds of choosing "25%" would be 2 out of 4, which is 50%.
